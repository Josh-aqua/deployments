For more information, see the product documentation: [Quick-Start Guide for Kubernetes](https://docs.aquasec.com/v5.3/docs/quick-start-guide-for-kubernetes).

For production usage, enterprise-grade deployments, and advanced use cases, as well as deployment on other Kubernetes platforms, go to 
[Deploy Aqua Enterprise](https://docs.aquasec.com/v5.3/docs/deployment-overview) and select the procedure that is relevant to your orchestration platform.

You can use the `aquactl download` command-line utility to automate the deployment steps of the manual procedures. This utility creates (downloads) manifests that are customized to your specifications. See [Aquactl: Download Deployment Manifests](https://docs.aquasec.com/v5.3/docs/aquactl-download-manifests).
